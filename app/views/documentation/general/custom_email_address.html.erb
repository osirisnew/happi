  <p>At the moment to prevent malicious users on our platform we will set up and approve your custom email address manually.</p>
  <p>Once you have configured email forwarding into Happi and have tested that it works, email <%= mail_to "support@in.happi.team" %> with your custom address and we can add this to your account so that all of your replies in Happi can be sent out using your own email address.</p>
